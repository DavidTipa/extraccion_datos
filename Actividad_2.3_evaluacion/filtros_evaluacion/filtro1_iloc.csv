Over the past 10 years I have hosted thousands of fellow earthlings from all over Gaia and come to know many of them and their cultures. 

It is incredibly inspirational being a host and I feel the world is coming closer as one with greater respect and understanding for each other.

Not surprisingly, I also love to travel, meet new people and their cultures but until now I have mostly only traveled in the far east and I have not yet crossed the dam.

If you desire I will also spend time with you, socializing and showing you the city. Use me as a guide or someone just to hang out with :)
