I am happy to live in times when people are more mobile than ever, traveling is easy and communities emerge thanks to such amazing services as Airbnb! 
I like the concept introduced by Taiye Selasi about being ""multi-local"" referring to people ""who feel at home in the town where they grew up, the city they live now and maybe another place or two"" - this describes me very well. I was born and raised in a multi-ethnic Kyrgyz Republic, graduated from a high school in the US, and now live and work in Oslo for almost 12 years. 

My professional background is in Radio & TV. Currently I work in a tech company providing online marketing services. Good conversations, long walks, dancing and being in the mountains are some of my energy sources. 

I love people and I love travelling, so Airbnb is my kind of service! I traveled and used Airbnb in Portugal, Spain, the US, Poland, Belize, Mexico, Belgium and absolutely loved it! Now, that I have an opportunity to host myself, I am excited to use all the knowledge and experience to make it a pleasant stay for my own guests.  

I look forward to meeting you, be it at your or my place!

Experience charming Rodeløkka as well as lively Grünerløkka with restaurants and shops.","The apartment is located in Rodeløkka, a charming historic neighborhood with a village atmosphere in the middle of the city. The neighborhood is located between Carl Berners Square and trendy Grünerløkka, with a selection of bars, restaurants and shops. The area is known for its old wooden houses that were basically built as a suburb of Christiania outside the city limits in the expansion of urban areas in 1859, and then there was a ban on building wooden houses in the city. This is therefore one of Oslo's few areas with this classic Norwegian village vibe. In 1988, the remaining wooden houses in the area were declared worthy of preservation.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-945439685926420081/original/483e0c34-012b-46a7-8459-068df835eb1d.jpeg,216983707,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/216983707,Nina,2018-09-24,"Akershus, Norway","Jeg ble født svært nysgjerrig og har alltid vært fasinert av mennesker, hvordan vi relaterer oss til hverandre og til denne svevende kulen vi liker å kalle ""Jorda"".

Så hyggelig at dere ønsker å bli bedre kjent m meg. Jeg heter Sherry Hakimnejad og er opprinnelig fra Iran.  Har bodd i Norge i snart 40 år. Jeg elsker å reise og treffe folk derfor ønsker jeg å bruke Airbnb når jeg selv er på farta. 
Sist gang var i India,like før lock down. Det anbefales.

Jeg elsker Oslo og det er den byen jeg alltid kommer tilbake til. Kjenner byen godt så spør gjerne om ting å gjøre når du er her.
Jobben min har lenge vært livet mitt. Jeg er en sosial entreprenør og jobber med å skape arbeidsplasser for ungdommer som på ulike måter strever med å komme seg inni arbeidslivet og stå på egne ben. 
Jeg føler meg så heldig og privilegert som bor i Norge og ønsker å bruke det gullkortet til å bidra til et bedre verden. 

Jeg elsker natur, mat, familien min, mine kollegaer, trening og ikke minst jobben min. Jeg er veldig nysgjerrig og uredd som både kan gjøre at jeg noen ganger havner i merkelige situasjoner. Men som oftest har det gitt mer lærdom og erfaring. 

Livet er for kort til å la vær å leves og det starter ofte med et godt hvilested.
