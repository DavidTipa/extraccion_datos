The following is about our former space in Guangzhou, China, which we had listed for many years:
Loft345 is an art space in Guangzhou's Haizhu district devoted to exhibitions, a wide range of performances, and affordable booze offered as unpretentiously as possible in a world of nauseating pomposity. Established in 2003 as Park19 and changing its name in 2005, Loft is one of Guangzhou's longest running art spaces. Known for student exhibitions, independent musical artists, and performance pieces ranging from dance to spoken word to the impenetrably strange, Loft attempts to be a place where independently minded artists and people who like to look at art can congregate and enjoy one another's company in peace. Some people describe it as a living room, some a dank hole--we'll leave it up to you to decide.

The problem is that these types of places are almost impossible to find. That’s why he decided to create his own category of exceptionally cool short-stay accommodation that combine the best of both worlds.

The area is very quiet, but still close to everything you need. The city center is less than a 20 minute walk, or 3-4 bus stops away. A direct bus to and from the airport stops right outside the apartment as well.<br /><br />If you're a group of 3 and looking for a centrally located place to sleep and make a few meals, then this apartment is perfect. If you plan to spend a lot of time inside, 1-2 guests here would be better.","The apartment is located right next to the famous St. Hanshaugen park. At the top of the hill you'll have a beautiful panoramic view of downtown Oslo. This park is also perfect for running, working out and even has a workout park.<br /><br />There are a handful of cozy cafes in the neighborhood as well as a grocery store right next to the apartment. There are also some really great restaurants close by. Feel free to ask me for recommendations! <br /><br />There are two main bus lines that run close to the apartment, including a bus that goes directly to and from the airport.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-953321114809634507/original/89096626-12f3-4ff2-b4fe-c597f075deb6.jpeg,37922012,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/37922012,Matthew,2015-07-08,"Oslo, Norway","Originally from Florida, USA but moved to Oslo in 2014 and somehow never left this beautiful country.

My life consists of working, spending time with family and friends, going to the theatre, cinema, concerts, trying to keep up with politics and what's happening in the world. 

Love to read, play volleyball also enjoy other sports. 

A perfect vacation in my opinion involves a lot of walking, exploring new places, getting to know the local people and culture, searching trough the area to find the best food, relaxing in a park with cheese, wine and a good book. A good vacation is the balance between relaxing /enjoying and exploring/getting new impulses. If you are planning a stay in Oslo, I am glad to help you to get the most out of your stay, whether you just want to stroll around eat and drink good, or want to get to know the quirks of the city.

I have travelled a lot the previous years (road-trip in USA, Marocco, Israel, Germany, England, France and Italy to mention a few). I've always stayed at hotels/hostels, and I think airbnb is a good alternative to the mundane hotel/hostel life. To get to stay in another person's home is a privilege. As a guest I think I would be seen as tidy, responsible, easy to co-operate with and in general a nice person. I have experience with people renting a room in my own flat, and know how important it is to have people you can trust and like. As a host, I take pride in offering the same things I would want when I travel: a nice and clean place to retreat from the city noice, where you can relax and be comfortable.
